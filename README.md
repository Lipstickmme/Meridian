# Meridian Constructions

Corporate website and API server for **Meridian Constructions**, a multidisciplinary
construction and engineering practice. A dependency-light Node/Express backend serves a
multi-page frontend and a small JSON API that powers the content, plus a working
live-chat endpoint.

## Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (single production dependency)
- **Frontend:** hand-written HTML / CSS / vanilla JS, assembled from shared
  partials by a tiny build step (no framework)
- **Data:** flat JSON files for content; enquiries, chat and inbound mail persisted to
  Supabase (Postgres) in production, or `data/` locally
- **Auth:** Supabase anonymous sign-in for visitors, password sign-in for staff, with
  row level security deciding what each can see
- **Notifications:** enquiries and chat messages routed to an inbox via Resend email
  and/or a webhook (Slack, Discord, help desk)
- **Inbound mail:** a signed Resend webhook archives and forwards mail sent to your domain

## Pages

| URL              | Page                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`              | Landing: six full-height chapters, ending in the enquiry form |
| `/projects`      | Filterable project listing with images                  |
| `/projects/:id`  | A page per project: hero, overview, key facts and an on-site gallery |
| `/services`      | The ten disciplines, each linking to its own page        |
| `/services/:id`  | A page per discipline: what it covers, what you get, where it shows |
| `/careers`       | Open roles and studio culture                           |
| `/apply`         | Recruitment form, with the role prefilled from the careers page |
| `/contact`       | Dedicated contact page with image, form and live chat   |
| `/admin`         | Studio desk: enquiries, live chat and studio mail (staff sign-in) |
| `404`            | Styled not-found page                                   |

A live-chat widget is available on every page except the studio desk.

## The landing page

Six chapters, each a full viewport tall with its own photograph, read as one
continuous surface: a single image is fixed behind the whole site and drifts as
you scroll, and every section lays its own artwork and scrim over it. A rail on
the right marks where you are. Section artwork settles into place as its chapter
arrives, reveals inside a chapter arrive in sequence rather than together, and
all of it stops under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

| # | Chapter | Carries |
| - | ------- | ------- |
| 1 | Hero | Slideshow, the two calls to action, and the practice readout |
| 2 | Capabilities | The four disciplines, from `/api/services` |
| 3 | Practice | Counters for the numbers the studio is held to |
| 4 | Leadership | How the practice is run, and who answers for it |
| 5 | Selected work | Three featured projects, from `/api/projects` |
| 6 | Contact | The enquiry form itself, not a link to one |

The form in chapter 6 is the same component as the one on `/contact`: both post
to `/api/contact`, so both land in `enquiries` and appear on the studio desk.

## Project and service pages

Every project and every discipline is rendered to its own static file at build
time — `public/projects/pier-j-berth.html`, `public/services/underwater.html` —
so `/projects/pier-j-berth` is a document with its own title, description and
content, not a shell that fills itself in once JavaScript has run. `src/site/detail.js`
builds them from the same JSON the API serves, and `project.html` / `service.html`
stay behind as the client-rendered fallback for an id added after the last build.

The portfolio spans commercial building, major civil engineering, oil and gas
facilities, marine and underwater welding, and energy work; each project carries
two gallery frames under the fold, and each discipline one.

Pictures come from a **shared library of twenty-four plates** in
`public/assets/img/lib/`, reused across projects, disciplines and page bands
rather than one photograph per slot. Fifteen are photographs; the nine that are
still drawings are the frames no photograph covers (the diving, the subsea work,
the tank shell, the switchyard). Nothing in the library carries a company name,
a logo or a hard-hat decal, and there is no portrait of a named person.

`npm run artwork` enforces the rules that keep reuse from reading as a mistake —
no plate twice on the same page, no two projects sharing a hero, no plate
pointing at a drawing that does not exist — and fails the build if one breaks.
`npm run build` prunes any project or service page whose id has gone from the
data, so a renamed project cannot leave a stale page behind. In the galleries,
alternate frames are cropped off-centre so a repeated plate reads as another
frame from the same job.

## Careers and applications

The apply link on `/careers` opens `/apply` with the role already selected, and the
form posts to `/api/applications`. Applications land in the `applications` table and
appear on the studio desk under their own tab, with the same triage states as an
enquiry. A speculative application, with no role chosen, is accepted the same way; a
role that has since closed is refused with a message rather than silently accepted.

## Contact details

The studio address, email, telephone and opening hours live in
`src/data/site.json`, so the pages are built with the right values and are
correct with no JavaScript at all. The studio desk can then change them under
**Settings**, which writes to `site_settings`, and every page picks the change
up on its next load through `/api/site`. No rebuild, no deploy. Anything
carrying `data-site="email"` and friends is hydrated, including the `mailto:`
and `tel:` hrefs, and a database with no `site_settings` table simply keeps the
values the site was built with.

## Live chat

Two halves of one conversation:

- **Visitor.** The widget signs in anonymously and writes its own rows, so row level
  security grants each visitor their own thread and nothing else. Where Supabase is
  not configured or anonymous sign-ins are off, it falls back to `POST /api/chat/message`,
  where the server holds the service role. Either way the conversation persists.
- **Studio.** `/admin` lists every conversation and replies into it. The first human
  reply sets `handled_by_agent`, which takes the thread off the automatic responder so
  the canned answer never talks over a person.

## API

| Method | Route                     | Description                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/health`             | Which config the server sees, plus warnings   |
| GET    | `/api/health?probe=1`     | The same, plus one read of every column the server uses |
| GET    | `/api/public-config`      | Supabase URL + anon key for the browser       |
| GET    | `/api/services`           | List engineering disciplines                  |
| GET    | `/api/projects?sector=`   | Project listing, optional sector filter       |
| GET    | `/api/projects/:id`       | Single project + the next project             |
| GET    | `/api/careers?team=`      | Open roles, optional team filter              |
| GET    | `/api/leadership`         | Practice leadership                            |
| GET    | `/api/team`               | Studio principals                             |
| POST   | `/api/contact`            | Submit an enquiry (validated + rate-limited)  |
| GET    | `/api/site`               | The studio's contact details, editable from the desk |
| POST   | `/api/applications`       | Submit a job application (validated + rate-limited) |
| POST   | `/api/chat/message`       | Send a chat message, get an auto-reply (fallback path) |
| POST   | `/api/chat/notify`        | Flag a browser-written message and post the holding reply |
| GET    | `/api/chat/:sessionId`    | Fetch a chat conversation                     |
| POST   | `/api/inbound/resend`     | Signed inbound-email webhook (archive + forward) |

`POST /api/contact` accepts `{ name, email, company?, service?, message, website? }`
(`website` is a honeypot); it returns `201`, `422` with a `fields` map, or `429`.

`POST /api/chat/message` accepts `{ sessionId, text }`, stores the message and a reply,
and returns both. `POST /api/chat/notify` is its companion for conversations the browser
writes itself: the message is already in the database, so it only raises the flag by
email and posts the holding reply. The responder in `src/controllers/chatController.js`
is rule-based and stands down the moment a person answers from `/admin`; it is the seam
where a third-party desk would take over instead.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # optional: adjust PORT, rate limits, notify email
npm run build          # generate public/*.html from src/site (also runs on start)
npm start              # http://localhost:3000
npm run dev            # build + watch mode
npm test               # API, chat and schema checks against a mock Supabase
```

`npm test` needs nothing beyond Node: `test/mock-supabase.js` stands in for PostgREST,
GoTrue and the row level security rules, and rejects a column that is not in the
schema, so code and migrations cannot drift apart unnoticed.

The end-to-end suites drive a real browser and need Playwright's Chromium:

```bash
npm install --no-save playwright-core   # plus a Chromium build
npm run test:browser                    # CHROME_PATH=... if it is not on the default path
```

## Frontend notes

- Pages share one layout (`src/site/layout.js`) rendered to static HTML at build
  time, so the nav, footer and chat widget stay consistent with no client-side flash.
- The palette is set at the foot of `public/css/styles.css` as `--meridian-ink`
  (deep teal, for type and the two dark bands), `-paper`, `-sand` and `-mist`
  (the tints that keep a long page from being one flat sheet), `-signal` (teal,
  for anything that points) and `-flare` (construction yellow, for anything
  measured: scale bars, the practice readout, the primary button, the rules
  under the section artwork). Change them there and the whole site follows.
  Type is Archivo over Inter, with IBM Plex Mono standing in for drawing
  annotation.
- Imagery runs at full strength, and where words sit over a picture the ground
  fades in behind them rather than a dark sheet being laid over the picture.
  `--bg-rgb` is the one token every one of those washes reads from.
- The home hero runs a **slideshow** of three plates (crossfade plus a slow Ken
  Burns zoom) with clickable indicators; motion drops under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`. Drop `meridian1` to `meridian3` in and they become
  photographs with no other change.
- Projects, careers and leadership content are rendered from the API, with embedded
  seed data as a fallback so pages never render empty.
- The wordmark is the practice's own logo, in `public/assets/brand/`. It was
  supplied on a white card, so the artwork is keyed off it — alpha from how dark
  each pixel is, then the colour un-premultiplied off the paper — which is what
  lets the gold sit on the ink nav and the limestone page alike. Two forms: the
  nav pairs the building mark with type set in the site's own faces, because a
  stacked logo shrunk into a 64px bar leaves the wordmark unreadable, and the
  footer carries the full lockup. `meridian-logo.webp` is the dark-type version
  for light surfaces, `meridian-logo-light.webp` the paper-type version for dark
  ones, and `meridian-mark.webp` the building on its own. The site icon
  (`favicon.svg`, `favicon.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`) is the same mark.
- Headings reveal with transform and opacity, never a `clip-path` wipe: clipping a
  heading to nothing leaves it with no rendered area, and IntersectionObserver then
  never reports it visible, so the reveal never fires. A browser test asserts every
  `[data-reveal]` on the landing page ends up visible.
- Section, service and project imagery lives in `public/assets/img/` as
  blueprint-style SVGs drawn by `npm run artwork`: a cyanotype ground, a survey
  grid, a title block and the structure in thin white line. They are honest
  placeholders rather than stock photographs of buildings this practice did not
  build, and real photography takes over from them as a file drop.

## Deploying

See **[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)** for the full walkthrough: replacing the
placeholder imagery, forking, deploying to Vercel, connecting a free Supabase database,
and routing enquiries and chat to your inbox.

The repo is Vercel-ready: `vercel.json` builds the static pages into `public/` and
`api/[...path].js` runs the Express API as a single serverless function.

## Notifications

Contact enquiries and live-chat messages are both routed to a human inbox by
`src/utils/notify.js`. Two independent channels, each a no-op until configured:

- **Email** via [Resend](https://resend.com): set `RESEND_API_KEY`, `FORM_TO` and `FORM_FROM`.
  Enquiry mail sets `reply_to` to the sender so replies reach the client directly.
- **Webhook** for a desk provider: set `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` (Slack, Discord, Zapier, help desk).

Inbound mail is handled by `POST /api/inbound/resend`. Requests must carry a valid
Svix-style signature (`RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`); unsigned, tampered or replayed requests
get a `401`. Verified mail addressed to `MAILBOX_ADDRESS` is filed onto a thread in
`email_threads` / `email_messages` and forwarded to `FORWARD_TO`, unless that address
(or the sender) is one of this site's own, which would loop mail back into the webhook.

Delivery is best effort and is awaited before responding, so a serverless invocation
never exits early. A notification failure is logged and never fails the visitor's
request. Set `CHAT_NOTIFY=off` to silence chat notifications while keeping enquiries.

## Storage

**Supabase** when `SUPABASE_URL` (or `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`)
and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are set; **local JSON files** under `DATA_DIR`
otherwise, so development works offline with no setup.

Tables are `admins`, `enquiries`, `applications`, `chat_sessions`, `chat_messages`
and, optionally, `email_threads` / `email_messages`. Create them by running
[`supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`](supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql) (and
[`0002_email.sql`](supabase/migrations/0002_email.sql)) in the Supabase SQL Editor.
Both are guarded, so re-running one after an edit updates what changed.

Row level security is on everywhere. `enquiries` has no anon policy at all: writes
arrive through `POST /api/contact` using the `service_role` key. Chat is the one thing
the browser writes directly, under the visitor's anonymous `auth.uid()`, and staff read
and answer under their own login checked against `admins`. Keep the `service_role` key
server side and never behind a `VITE_` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix, which are inlined into
browser bundles; the `anon` key is meant to be public.

`GET /api/health?probe=1` reads one row of every column the server uses and names
anything missing, which is the quickest way to catch tables built from an older copy of
a migration.

Vercel is serverless with a read-only filesystem, so production needs the database:
without it, writes go to `/tmp` and do not survive between requests.

## Images

Page-level artwork is a file drop, not a code change: put `meridian1` to `meridian5`
into `public/assets/img/` (any of `.webp`, `.avif`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`) and the
next build uses them. Names are matched without regard to case, and `.webp` wins
when both a PNG and a WebP of the same name are present, so adding an optimised
copy beside a heavy original is enough to serve it. `meridian1` becomes the underlay behind every page; the rest
take a chapter each.

`src/data/images.json` holds the mapping, where every slot names the file it prefers
and the placeholder it falls back on, and `src/site/images.js` resolves them at build
time. So the site never shows a broken image while artwork is still being collected,
and the build prints which real files it picked up. Per-project images live in
`src/data/projects.json` and the leadership portrait in `src/data/leadership.json`,
whose `name` is deliberately empty until a real principal fills it in: while it is,
the leadership chapter credits the practice rather than inventing a person. See the
table in [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#step-1-add-your-images).

One generator draws what is not photographed yet. It is deterministic, so
re-running it changes nothing unless the source changed:

```bash
npm run artwork   # the leadership plate + the 10 library drawings
```

The site icons are the logo's building mark and live in `public/`, so nothing
regenerates them; replacing the logo means replacing them too.

`npm run artwork` checks every image the data points at, so a new project cannot
ship with a broken image or an accidental duplicate.

**Replacing the remaining drawings.** `docs/IMAGE-PROMPTS.md` lists what is
already photographed and where each plate appears, then carries a complete
prompt — scene, camera settings, house style, aspect ratio — for each of the ten
frames still outstanding. Save the photograph beside the drawing it replaces,
then:

```bash
npm run adopt-photos   # rewrites the data files to use the photographs
npm run build
```
